    <h1>Welcome to Git Overview</h1>

    <p>This page provides a brief introduction to Git, a powerful version control system.</p>

    <h2>What is Git?</h2>

    <p>Git is like the save feature in a video game. Just as you save your progress to avoid losing your achievements, Git lets you save snapshots of your code. If something goes wrong, you can load a previous save and continue working without losing your progress, just like in a game. But Git also lets multiple people work together and explore different strategies using branches, so everyone can collaborate and try new ideas without losing progress.</p>
